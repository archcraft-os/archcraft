# File made in favor of the prominent and more up to date rtl8821ce dkms driver by tomaspinho on GitHub. ( https://github.com/tomaspinho/rtl8821ce#wi-fi-not-working-for-kernel--59)
# As the kernels newer than 5.9 will crash and panic the kernel with the current broken version of this driver inbuilt in the linux kernel by realtek ( likely to be never fixed by realtek for linux ) ( it has some power delivery issues )
